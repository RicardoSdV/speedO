How to use:
    Should be able to run any of the files that don't start with z_ with any 
    interpreter or possibly JIT which is at least between Python27-313 or maybe even more

Sometimes I run into a thing that can be done in more than one way and I ask myself 
which is better, so normally I do some simple tests to see which is broadly faster
but those tests are lost which seems to be a pity so the idea is to add them here

Unless whatever is being tested is specific to a range of python versions it should
be compatible with any version so can compare performance in a range of versions by
only switching the interpreter or JIT etc...

Must say that this is not the best way to perform the tests, its good enough, and the 
point is to find orders of magnitude differences, not small percentages.

Cool ideas:
    - Potentially a more correct time could be calculated by for example, if the test requires
    to loop through a 2D list, then, calculating the time it takes to loop through a 2D list 
    without performing any operations and then subtracting that time from the time of the test
    automatically.

    - To get better measurements maybe the number of runs should be larger, but not large enough
    that the calling of the test funcs skews the test, maybe 10 to 20 runs. Also, the min, max,
    median, mean, should probably be calculated, and probably the most accurate is some combination
    of the mean and median. Although, the idea is that the test functions contain some loop that 
    repeats the code being tested so many times that whatever irregularities are smoothed out, 
    but this theory is only partially true, specially for memory tests. 


P.D. Dam that's a lot of text, now it tests memory usage too.
