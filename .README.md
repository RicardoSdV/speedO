Sometimes I run into a thing that can be done in more than one way and I ask myself 
which is better, so normally I do some simple tests to see which is broadly faster
but those tests are lost which seems to be a pity so the idea is to add them here

Unless whatever is being tested is specific to a range of python versions it should
be compatible with any version so can compare performance in a range of versions by
only switching the interpreter

Must say that this is not the best way to perform the tests, its good enough, and the 
point is to find orders of magnitude differences, not small percentages.

Also, good to know that the faster the thing getting tested the more inaccurate the test
because the for loops and whatever else is needed to perform the test takes a larger
% of the time of the test. So in something very fast, like accessing an attr, a 20% difference
is more significant than in something very slow like popping from the front of a very long list


Cool ideas:
    - Potentially a more correct time could be calculated by for example, if the test requires
    to loop through a 2D list, then, calculating the time it takes to loop through a 2D list 
    without performing any operations and then subtracting that time from the time of the test
    automatically.
